# ModernQuantum
A modernized quantum delta, taking advantage of all the recent advances in 3D printing technology. Featuring direct drive boombox, awd motion, and more. 

100mm bed with a 110v mains heater and motion powered by awd NEMA 17 on 6mm belts. Electronics are fysetc duet clone boards running RRF. Lancer long hotend with a melt zone extender and custom mounting plate. Triple 8038 fan part cooling providing a whopping 372cfm of air. Direct drive boombox for ultra high acceleration extruder moves. 
Just barely big enough to be useful - yet it will probably crank out a stupid fast speedbenchy. 

This design was made with a lot of help from many members of the community, especially James Pray - the creator of the BoomBox extruder. Thank you so much.
